# Assignment 2

So we have a document (table) of Courses and a document of Students. The natural evolution is to have the students register for courses.
Associating students to courses is, in the relational database sense, a many-to-many operation.

Add to your API a "register" message that has as parameters a courseId and a studentId. The API should indicate success or failure. Failure happens when the requested registration would result in a schedule conflict. This execution of "business logic" is intentionally off-loaded to the server.

A dataset and test cases will be provided.

When complete, zip and upload your API changes.
