So, we currently have an API that implements CRUD operations on the CourseSchedule document/table.

Now, expand your API & database to support a Student document/table that looks something like this:

{
    schoolId:193301234,
    firstName:"Jim-Bob",
    lastName:"Walton",
    dob:"24/11/1924",
    addressUnit:"001",
    addressStreet:"Main St.",
    addressCity:"Walton's Mt.",
    addressStateProv:"VA",
    addressCountry:"USA",
    addressPostCode:"24411"
    phone:"(434) 555 1212",
    email:"jbwalton@email.com",
    emergContactName:"John Walton Sr.",
    emergContactPhone:"(434) 555 1213",
    emergContactRel:"Father",
    program:"Carpentry"
}

Create at least one Postman message for each CRUD operation. Screen capture the starting of your API. Test your API's new record with those Postman messages, taking screen shots as you go. Please give the screenshot descriptive names, not like "capture1.png, capture2.png, ...", but like "getStudents.png, getStudentById.png, ...".

Zip up your model, controller, router, and app JavaScript files with your screen shot files, and upload and submmit the archive to this dropbox. DO NOT zip the entire project. Doing so will include your node modules; just under 100,000 files and several gigs. Anyone who submits your entire project will not be assessed and will recieve a 0.
